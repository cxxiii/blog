        Often, we don't say what we think; more often, we don't write what we
        believe.
      </p>

      <p>The medium is the message.</p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, however, we take the time to think about things, only to find
        ourselves ensnared by semantics. In the same vein, the minds of many
        people appear to be possessed, or otherwise entangled, by ideas and
        thoughts which appear meaningless when we think about them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We, as a species, are in the habit of inventing artificial constructs,
        realizations of concepts, to name things, thereby divorcing them from
        their natural nameless forms. To name something is to guillotine that
        thing. Our minds have limited capacity, so we must make do with names
        and labels. We must abstract, which is the principal problem with
        language.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use language as a means to convey what we believe to be meaning.
        Language is made up of words, of lines or strokes, of orthography. To
        differentiate between conveying meaning and having meaning: words, in
        and of themselves, as specks of inks or bits of pixels, do not have
        meaning; they have uses. Words are tools. They have no meaning the same
        way a sledgehammer has no meaning. Like sledgehammers, words are tools
        for specific purposes. Our words are tools for communicative and
        descriptive purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Function-wise, words are agents of separation. If you approach any given
        thing and call it a particular thing, then, by inversion, you are saying
        that it cannot be another thing. The savior a prophet or a son …
        Sometimes the smallest gradations of our words can make for the biggest
        differences in our world. Language frames our realities. If that is so,
        and political campaigns work and seize people's hearts and minds like
        so, this may effect more peril and more evil just as much - if not more
        often than - as it may serve as a force for good. Worse, if a concept,
        evil or good, cannot be described in our language, then, as far as we're
        concerned, it might as well not exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not so much a problem with words themselves as with how our minds
        operate. Our minds are locked in a constant struggle between one concept
        and another. Any thesis written down spells out its antithesis. Left
        points out right; liberalism draws the shadow of conservatism. We
        palliate this disease of the mind by imposing patterns, borders, and
        categories on all things and ideas, including morality. We end up
        weaponizing our words and dodging them like bullets.
      </p>

      <p>
        If words can be deadly like this, then we ought to be wary of the danger
        of cramming concepts of people into words when, in war, denominations
        become deathtraps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Words desynchronize with their original meaning because they are static.
        They are prone to deprecate, lose their use, once removed from their
        immediate, appropriate context. Like old war-time bombs and mines, they
        grow more dangerous, more unstable, with time. Words are not children,
        but prisoners of their time and, at the same time, inhibitors of the
        times. Meaning, on the other hand, is the times; it is fluid, adaptive,
        and evolving. It is forever the inexpressible everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Language, as a system in and of itself, is a true marvel of human
        achievement, something to be relished. Words can, and ought to be,
        beautiful. But words can only ever be sincere for their own sake, in
        relationship to themselves, not in relationship to the whole. If life is
        a relationship to the whole, and we sometimes happen to desire to
        express ourselves, our momentary whole, with a degree of sincerity our
        words don't allow for, we feel frustration or even violence. In those
        situations we grasp for words or signs that are not there to communicate
        something sincere. We end up substituting with words we did not mean to
        say to people we did not intend to hurt. It is how conversation breaks
        down, how relationships fall apart, how we get ourselves in trouble. It
        is the insurmountable divide between words said and meaning intended.
      </p>

      <p>
        It can't be coincidence that couples, for example, fight with words but
        make up with touch. Society at large seems to acknowledge that,
        ultimately, words are an inferior way of expressing emotion or
        sincerity. That is not to say, however, that meaning cannot be discussed
        at all. Humans are capable of empathy, which allows us to trace another
        person's meaning behind their words. Like beacons signaling ships into
        harbor, we manage to arrange the artificiality of words in such a way as
        to reveal, not obstruct, our meanings to one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Can you put love for a person into words and still be sincere? I think
        not, although the thought itself is not absurd. At some point, billions
        of years ago, the universe gave birth to itself from the nothing. Then,
        at some further point in time, the animate must have sprung from the
        inanimate. It is not inconceivable, then, that love can live in lifeless
        objects such as words. But should love depend on words, being what they
        are? No, I don't believe so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sincerity should not be mistaken for truth. Truth is a construct of the
        mind, whereas sincerity is an expression of the heart. As possessors of
        hearts and writers of words, it is always more seductive for us to be
        sincere liars rather than propagators of insincere truths. And yet, a
        single act of goodness can furl the flapping banner sewn with our every
        hurtful lie and words of hatred.
